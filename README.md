### Objective: create a website application that works with two API’s, uses AJAX, has a repeating element with persistent data storage.

### 1. Philips Hue API information:

- Hue by Philips is a wireless LED lighting system which uses bulbs that allow the user to control their lights from the web. These smart bulbs produce a range of colors and intensities. They are connected to the bridge, which is a device used to communicate with the bulbs via the internet.


- By using Philips Hue API we are able to combine it with other applications. The bridge and the application must be on the same local network in order to communicate with the bulbs. The bridge connects with the bulbs via an open standards protocol called ZigBee light link.


- Philips Hue uses an interface called ‘API debug tool’ which takes the IP address of the bridge and returns any data related to the bulb in JSON format using the ‘GET’ method. To make changes to the bulb like turning on/off the bulb, brightness, hue, and saturation the ‘PUT’ and ‘POST’ method is used.


### 2. About the Color Tag API:        


- Color Tag is a free API application that takes inserted images and color swatches them into HTML hex codes. Color tag is a simple but very useful API mostly used for color naming and identifying the dominant color of an image.


- “Color Tag returns a JSON object that contains color tags for the image specified by the URL or a tag image that is uploaded by the user.”- The  Rapid API. The demo can be found: http://apicloud.me/apis/colortag/demo/ .


- This data output in two options. The first is simple where it returns colors in an object in a string. It has limited color selections. The second is a pallet that is w3c compatible. It returns 1,500 possible color names and up to a max of 20 colors per image. Image types supported are JPEG, PNG, and GIF. With a max resolution of 8192 X 8192 and a max file size of 20 MBytes.


### 3. Trellos Agile Process

### 4. Conclusion:


- In closing, we plan to combine these two API’s to make nice ease of use of the application and an enjoyable experience for anyone who owns a Philips Hue bulb. Sometimes seeing an image we like doesn’t make it easy for us to truly identify the color and this is a great way to easily and accurately adjust your smart lights into a custom pallet. Having a range of hue lighting really makes a difference in the atmosphere and helps the user be immersed in their environment.
